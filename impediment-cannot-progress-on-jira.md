Hi Lead,
    
    In Abc* application, authentication is failing with local setup.
    Nagesh tried to help me out in debugging the issue but we were not able to pin the issue down.
    With this impediment, I am unable to progress on this JIRA until work outside of my control is done.
    This impediment seems serious because it gives the impression that I have accepted work that I was not in a position to complete.
    
    Request you to please provide me a method for overcoming this blocker.
        
Regards
