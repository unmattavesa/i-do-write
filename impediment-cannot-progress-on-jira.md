            Hi Lead,
            
            In Abc* application, authentication is failing with local setup.
            Nagesh tried to help me out in debugging the issue but we were not able to pin the issue down.
            With this impediment, I am unable to progress on this JIRA until work outside of my control is done.
            This impediment seems serious because it gives the impression that I have accepted work that I was not in a position to complete.
            
            Request you to please provide me a method for overcoming this blocker.
            
            Regards
            @unmattavesa
